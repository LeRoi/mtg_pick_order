# mtg_pick_order
For M:tG players who need a quick primer to draft formats they're new to.

This python application allows M:tG players who are new to a format, need a leg up in drafting, or just need a second opinion on comparing two potential first picks, to get a leg up on the competition. Type in names of cards that you want analyzed, and get the card's ranking returned back, on an absolute scale of 0.0 to 5.0.

Controls  
Enter - Input new card (preserves old search results)  
Backspace - Undo previous keystroke, or on empty line, clears the line  
Ctrl + D - Clear line  
Ctrl + C - Exit
